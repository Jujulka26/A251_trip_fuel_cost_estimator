# Trip Fuel Cost Estimator
This is a simple Flutter application designed to estimate the fuel cost for a trip. Users input the trip distance in kilometers, their vehicle's fuel efficiency in km/L, and select the fuel type from a dropdown menu. The app then calculates and displays the estimated fuel cost in Malaysian Ringgit (RM) based on predefined fuel prices, with a splash screen for initial loading.

# Inputs → Process → Output
Inputs:
* Distance: Numeric value in kilometers (entered via TextField).
* Fuel Efficiency: Numeric value in km/L (entered via TextField).
* Fuel Type: Selected from a dropdown menu (options: RON95(subsidized), RON95, RON97, Diesel).

Process:
* Validate inputs: Ensure distance and efficiency are non-negative, and efficiency is not zero.
* Retrieve fuel price based on selected fuel type (hardcoded values: RON95(subsidized) = 1.99 RM/L, RON95 = 2.05 RM/L, RON97 = 3.14 RM/L, Diesel = 2.89 RM/L).
* Calculate fuel consumption: distance / efficiency.
* Compute estimated cost: fuel consumption * fuel price, rounded to two decimal places.

Output:
* Display the estimated fuel cost in RM within a styled container.
* Show error messages for invalid inputs (e.g., negative values or zero efficiency).

# Widgets Used
* Text: For displaying labels, titles, and output messages.
* TextField: For user input of distance and fuel efficiency.
* DropdownButton: For selecting the fuel type.
* ElevatedButton: For "Calculate Cost" and "Reset" actions.
* Row/Column: For layout structuring, such as aligning inputs and buttons horizontally/vertically.
* Container: For styling the output display box with borders, shadows, and padding.

# Basic Validation Approach
The app performs basic input validation in the calculateCost method:
* Checks if distance or efficiency are negative, displaying an error message if so.
* Checks if efficiency is zero to avoid division by zero, displaying a specific error.
* If distance is zero, it proceeds but shows a cost of 0.00 with a note.
* Uses double.tryParse to handle non-numeric inputs gracefully (defaults to 0.0).
* Updates the UI state with error flags to change text color and border for visual feedback.
